**PROJECT TITLE** : PREDICTING LIFE EXPECTANCY USING MACHINE LEARNING

**CATEGORY** : MACHINE LEARNING

**PROJECT DESCRIPTION** :
In this project tries to create a new model based on the data provided is 
to evaluate the life expectancy in different countries.The scope of this project is to predict the estimate of the mean or average of life expectancy. 
According to the recent study, There is a 15% chance that life expectancy will decline in the future. 
If it happens so, the average value of the range of possible life expectancies in future days is going to fall. 
Talks among a group of experts and systematic consideration of various scenarios would undoubtedly produce values different from 15% and 70 years.
